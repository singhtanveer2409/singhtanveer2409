👋 Hey, I’m an MCA student & aspiring developer
I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Application (MCA) at MIT World Peace University, Pune, focused on strengthening my core computer science fundamentals and building real-world applications through hands-on development.
I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science from K.K. Wagh College (SPPU), where I discovered my interest in building practical, problem-solving tech solutions — not just writing code that passes exams.

* Academic Projects (B.Sc. Final Year)

1- Driving School Management System
Web application built using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Manages student records, schedules, and fee payments

2- Hall Ticket Generation using QR Code

Secure hall ticket generation and verification system
Implemented QR code–based validation using PHP

These projects helped me gain confidence in backend development, full-stack workflows, and building systems from scratch with real constraints.

- Currently Learning

Data Analytics
Modern Web Technologies
JavaScript Frameworks
Git & GitHub
AI tools and applications

Basically: leveling up to be industry-ready, not tutorial-ready
